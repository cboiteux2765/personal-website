            Learning how to code was never an easy path for
            me. I failed 6 times to understand and enjoy
            programming, but the 7th time, I persevered with
            a growth mindset and it suddenly became my passion.
            This struggle has inspired me to host programming
            camps for kids, teach hackathon workshops, and 
            teach at my high school's programming club to help
            others learn CS in a more intuitive fashion.
